A to-do list web application allows users to manage tasks, organized into projects or separate lists.

# Features
- Create, edit, and delete task items
- Setting task properties such as description, due date, and priority
- Filter tasks by Today/ThisWeek/Projects
- Data persists via localStorage

# What I learned
- Develop application using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concept
- using SOLID design principle
- How to manage json packages
- How to structure code into separate modules for application logic and DOM interactions
- Use `localStorage` to save and retrieve user data
- I learned how to design and plan webpage prototypes in Figma, which helped me organize the layout and user flow before writing any code.
